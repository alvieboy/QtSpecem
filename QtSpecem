Z80 C emulation Copyright 1991-2019 Rui Fernando Ferreira Ribeiro

ZX Spectrum 48K emulator using Qt5 Library

Using my old ancient Z80 core in C much improved and with bugs fixed. 
Full compatibility with documented and undocumented Z80 Zilog behaviour except for a partial implementation of the WZ/MEMPTR register.

Compiled/teste in MacOS Mojave and Debian 10.

Whilst the Z80 emulation is quite satisfactory, this version still has a basic interface, and is out in the open for people to test the Z80 emulation.

The end objective of this emulator will be more for a debugging than an emulator plataform. Whilst there are plans for a debugger, There are no prospects to implement sound in the near future.
